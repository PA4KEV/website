Field day - De Groote Peel, Kokmeeuwenweg
=========================================

_2024-01-20_

This day was a failure to me.

I was only to make 1 park-to-park QSO with SP3W/P, in SP-1888 and SP-1878 in Poland.

I had to suddenly tear down my station immediately (and rightfully so) by Staatsbosbeheer, the organization that maintains nature preserves in the Netherlands. I was deployed in a vulnerable area. There was a sign, which I did not see. Stupid of me.

It was a succesful test for my new antenna deployment though. I made use of a plastic tube, strong screwing pegs and special hooks from Nite Ize.

The mastholder, bit of a mess currently. I should be able to improve this...

The sign, that I sadly did not notice. It is important to respect these areas, so pay attention to the surroundings when you will do an activation.

"Kwetsbaar gebied" = _Vulnerable area_, "Geen toegang" = _Access denied_.

The maintainer of Staatsbosbeheer comes to write the fine.

I admit being wrong here, I had no problem accepting the fine. It is important to respect the rules of the park. Make sure you are not in a closed-off area and start putting pegs in the ground. For the ground and the life in it may be disturbed. Do not annoy others with your hobby and respect the rules.

The fine is €100 ($108 £85 ¥16105) plus €9 ($9,7 £7,6 ¥1450) administration costs, which falls just outside of the criminal offense range.
